## Slide 1

*(This is the cover slide)*

In this video I'd like to talk about the data scientist: what kind of skills
does a data scientist need to have? What is the required knowledge?


## Slide 2

As we've seen before, data science draws on many different disciplines:
statistics, computer science, research, business, communication.
Statistics is where much of data science's theoretical basis comes from,
its way of proceeding draws heavily on scientific research, but its rise
is strongly influenced by the latest developments in technology and
software.


## Slide 3

It takes time to master any one of these disciplines, let alone all of
them. This is the main reason why data science is usually a "second
calling" - many data scientists have started out their professional careers as
programmers, statisticians, business analysts or academic scientists. People in
those professions have already mastered a number of the skills required for
data science; after making the choice to transition into this new field, they
add some more skills to their existing repertoire in order to become effective
data scientists.


## Slide 4

Alright, but what are the skills that a data scientist needs to have?

Well, data science as such is a relatively new field and, though most
practitioners will agree on what constitutes its core, there isn't a unanimous
view on what a detailed curriculum on this subject should
look like. What is clear, however, is that you need to learn a lot of
stuff. Or maybe not learn it all, but at least you'll need to have a good
idea about quite a few things.

The Venn diagram presented here is commonly used to illustrate the
combination of skill sets required to be a successful data scientist: a
combination of hacking (that is, programming ability), math knowledge, and
subject matter expertise, business experience.


## Slide 5

For this discussion I'll use this modified version as illustration, which
adds an extra dimension: communication skills. Communication is implicit in the
previous version, but I think it's important to mention it explicitly.


## Slide 6

So, to become a successful data scientist, your goal is to be in the area
of the diagram which I've outlined in yellow here, blending skills from
all four major areas: statistics, programming, communication skills and
domain knowledge.

Of course, you'll be stronger in some areas, and weaker in others. And at
the start of your journey into data science, this ideal blend of skills
will be in the distant horizon.


## Slide 7

If you are coming to data science from academia (like I did), you are
likely starting out from somewhere in the region outlined here in green.
You do have at least a good mathematical foundation, experience with research,
sometimes even some programming knowledge. Your main challenge is to acquire
domain expertise: academia can be a very peculiar place, and the transition to
industry may be more or less traumatic. Processes are different, the jargon is
different, the goals and expectations are different. Don't be afraid to
admit what you don't know!

Also, and this is very important, you need to learn to communicate with
non-technical people. In academia you usually interact with other subject
matter experts, or with students in your own field. In data science, you need
to talk more like a science communicator.


## Slide 8

If you are a business analyst or an actuary you probably are on the opposite
side of the diagram. You already are in the industry, so no problem there,
and you have a more or less in depth knowledge of statistics or data
analysis. What you mainly need to develop are programming skills, in order to
get proficient in machine learning applications.

Note that, relative to the goal, you are in the region opposite to the
scientist. Both profiles complement each other very well! You have analytics as
a common ground, and you can supply business expertise while the scientist
provides the machine learning skills.


## Slide 9

People coming from computer science or software engineering have some
advantages, mainly that they already possess technical skills and business
knowledge. However, these people come into data science from what some call the
"danger zone". What do we mean by that?

Well, IT professionals "know enough to be dangerous". If you have this
background, you are perfectly capable of extracting and structuring data, and
probably even run some type of predictive model and report the coefficients.
The problem is, it's possible that you lack any understanding of what those
coefficients mean. The technical skills you have give you the ability to create
what appears to be a legitimate analysis, without really understanding how you
got there or what you have created.

Now, this does not mean you cannot be a good, even great, data scientist! It
just means that you need to be careful with your statistics, and make sure you
take your time to understand your data and its limitations.


## Slide 10

OK, enough about generalities. I hope I have given you a general picture of the
typical profiles of people who come into data science, and what are the
advantages and disadvantages of each. In the next lecture we'll go into more
detail, and talk about which specific knowledge and technological skills are
most useful for data science.
