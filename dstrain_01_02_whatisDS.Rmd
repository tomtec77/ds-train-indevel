## Slide 1

Data science is currently getting a lot of hype. Here is for example this
article, which appeared in October 2012 in the Harvard Business Review,
which straight away calls data science "the 21st Century's sexiest job".
That is probably a bit of an exaggeration, although we data scientists are
unlikely to object to being called "sexy".


## Slide 2

The field of data science is experiencing tremendous growth. Here are some
current trends, extracted from an article which appeared on Forbes
magazine in October 2016.

- First, the demand for deep analytical talent in the U.S. is projected to
be 50-60 per cent greater than supply by 2018, leading to a massive
shortage of qualified data scientist, analysts and managers.
- In the first quarter of 2015, the number of job postings for data
scientist grew 57% year-over-year while searches for data scientist grew
73.5% for the same period, as more and more companies become interested in
applying data science.
- Data scientist was ranked the best job in the U.S. because of its high
earning potential, abundant career opportunities, and number of job
openings.


## Slide 3

Right, so it's a growing and exciting field, but what is it exactly?

As a discipline, data science is relatively new, even though many of the
techniques it uses have been around for decades. For some people (myself
included) data science is truly a new field, but for others it is a
faddish misrepresentation of work that has already been done. And though
there is a general consensus on what the fundamentals of data science are,
there's plenty of different views on its particulars and scope.

What follows is my personal interpretation of what data science is.


## Slide 4

The name "data science" itself has been around for a while. It probably
appeared sometime in the mid-1990s, but started to gain popularity after
the publication, in 2001, of an article by William Cleveland (computer
scientist and statistician then at Bell Labs) titled *Data Science: An
Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics*.

Here's the first page of the article. Right at the beginning we can read
that this "action plan" proposed by Cleveland has a focus on the data
analyst, that is a focus on practical applications rather than on theory.
His plan implies substantial change, and the outcome is much more than
just applied statistics; thus, he gives the transformed field the name of
"data science".


## Slide 5

This new field of data science is an interdisciplinary field, which goes
beyond statistics to include machine learning, fundamentally, and many
other practices enabled or enhanced by recent developments in information
technology. Data science tackles a wide variety of problems, not only from
business but also from other areas such as public administration or
healthcare.


## Slide 6

What about us? Well, here's our definition. We will define data science as
the management of a process that can transform hypotheses and data into
actionable predictions and insights.

The key word here is **process**.


## Slide 7

What does this process look like? Well, it will be the topic of a lecture
on its own, but for illustration purposes here is a preview. Warning: this
is a **very** simplified picture! It is hardly ever a linear,
straightforward process, as we'll see when we consider it in detail in a
later video. But, for starters, we need to go over these stages: formulate
the problem, collect and process the data, do some machine learning and
finally present our results in a useful manner.

At each of the different stages we'll require different tools to complete
the necessary tasks. This fact, added to the wide variety of problems that
data science tackles, gives the field its interdisciplinary character.


## Slide 8

Let's briefly go over these stages. All data science projects
start, or should start, with the formulation of the problem. More
precisely, with a question or a definite goal. For example: how can I
increase the engagement of my customers? Can I automatically detect happy
or angry clients? What should I do to optimize energy consumption? How
should I allocate available resources to best administer healthcare?

With a precise question or goal we can then formulate a plan of action and
identify the type of machine learning task we will require. Is it a
classification problem? Regression? Clustering? What kind of data will I
need to make predictions? Don't worry if any of these terms do not sound
familiar; during this training we'll learn what those methods are about.


## Slide 9

Once we have formulated the problem, we now need to collect, process and,
most importantly, **understand** the data. You really cannot afford to go
quickly over this stage. Many models fail because people make wrong
assumptions about their data. Plotting your data is a must! Plots are
irreplaceable tools to help you make sense of the data. Make as many as
you need, and then some more!

As a working data scientist, you will spend the majority of your time in
any given project working on this stage. You need to make sure you know
your data very well before moving on, and you'll frequently come back to
this stage when later modelling and analysis reveal surprising or
unexpected behavior.


## Slide 10

With the data carefully analyzed and processed, now comes the time when we
employ machine learning algorithms to build a model, which we use to make
predictions and attempt to answer the question that we began with. In
general we need to try out different models to find out which one performs
best (according to expectations we have set at the beginning of the
project). We'll also have to take into consideration the cost of
implementing different possible solutions.

Now a warning: machine learning is certainly the core of data science, but
it's not what you'll spend most of your time doing. And it's also not just
a "software engineering" matter of plugging a data pipeline at one end, a
machine learning prepackaged kit in the middle, and a data visualization
at the other end. Dedicated work in understanding the data at the previous
stage will pay off here, and careless or hasty work in data processing
will result in costly mistakes when modeling. Machine learning does not do
magic: if you feed it garbage, it will return garbage. Sometimes
gold-plated, but garbage nonetheless.


## Slide 11

Finally, once we have a good enough model (we'll see in later lectures
what it means to be "good enough") we need to communicate the results via
a report, a visualization, an application; the extracted knowledge and
insights leads to better decision making.

In the illustration here, we have a scenario where a user is faced with
growing energy costs, has lots of data but cannot make any sense of it.
Applying data science, we go from the question "how can I reduce my energy
consumption?" via data and analysis to an app which helps this consumer to
make informed decisions and be more energy efficient.


## Slide 12

To summarize: data science is about managing a process which, starting
from a question, turns data into actionable predictions and insights.
Given the breadth of its scope, this new field draws on many disciplines
and technologies; machine learning is at its core, but it is much more
than that, with a strong spirit of research and discovery.
