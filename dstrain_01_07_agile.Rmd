## Slide 1 (Title)


## Slide 2

What is Agile? Agile methodologies provide a light framework that contains a
set of practices and techniques which enable a development team to deliver
value to the client and to adapt to change, reducing the risk associated with
uncertainty. Agile is a time-boxed, iterative approach to software delivery
that builds incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to
deliver it all once near the end.

Agile works by breaking projects down into single items of user functionality
called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them
in short two-week cycles called iterations or sprints.

Throughout the continuous planning and feedback cycles, teams ensure that they
meet business needs and that any change required by the client can be assessed
quickly in order to determine its feasibility according to the current
priorities.


## Slide 3

How does Agile work? Well, first you make a list of the features your client
would like to see in their software. These are the user stories, and they are
basically your "to do list". Then you size things up: you estimate how much
work you'll need to complete the stories, sizing them up relative to each
other. You ask the customer to set priorities, that is, what is more important,
what he wants to get done first, and then get to work, getting feedback from
your customer as you go.


## Slide 4

As you start delivering completed features, you'll either a) going fast enough,
in which case all is good, or b) you don't have enough time to complete your
tasks. If this is the case, then you either revise your scope, leaving out less
essential features, or ask the client for more time and money. People usually
recommend going for the first option!


## Slide 5

In Agile, working software is the primary measure of success. The rate at which
teams can turn their customer's wishes into working software is how
productivity is measured in this methodology.

Documentation and reports get treated like any other deliverable: they get
estimated, sized and prioritized like any other user story.


## Slide 6

Now this is all very cool, but can you actually use an Agile methodology to
manage the data science process? Well, you can, but let me tell you it isn't
easy.

In Agile there is an idea of continuously moving forward in small increments,
adding more and more functionality to what will eventually be the final
software product. Now, the final item of a data science project may be a
software data product, which can be developed using an Agile framework. The
problem comes mainly from trying to fit the initial stages (data collection and
cleaning, model building and model evaluation) within Agile.

In a previous video, when talking about the importance of reproducible
research, I mentioned that the one and only thing that a data scientist can
guarantee about the data science work is its reproducibility. Everything else
is uncertain! At the beginning you don't know what the data looks like or
whether there are any issues affecting the data. You may have an idea of which
machine learning algorithm you are going to try, but there is no real guarantee
that your initial choice will achieve the project goals. And you also may
discover unexpected things along the way! All this uncertainty greatly affects
the definition and estimation of user stories.

Let's consider an example. Let's imagine that we want to create an app to 
predict airline flight delays. At the beginning, we are promised access to data
containing a large number of variables (data on repairs to the aircraft,
typical delays at the different airports, weather conditions etc) and since we
have to predict a numerical quantity (delay time) we decide we'll start by
trying a multivariate linear regression. 

OK, so the team gets together, creates the user stories and assigns tasks,
which could be something like this:

- Collect data
- Data analysis
- Build model
- Evaluate model
- Create application front end
- Deploy the application



Do as much front end work in parallel as possible.
Don't create "generic" tasks 

Now, if we
