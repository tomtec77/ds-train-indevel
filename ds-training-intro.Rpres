Welcome to the Data Science Training!
========================================================

Welcome indeed!


What is Data Science?
========================================================

The term "data science" probably appeared in the mid-1990s but became 
popularised by William Cleveland, computer scientist and statistician then
at Bell Labs, who in 2001 published the article
[*Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics*](https://utexas.instructure.com/files/35465950/download).

Cleveland defined data science as an **interdisciplinary field larger than
statistics itself**.

In PDSwR, Zumel & Mount define data science as **the management of a
process that can transform hypotheses and data into actionable predictions
and insights**.

Data Science as a "Second Calling"
========================================================

**Data science draws on many disciplines.** Much of its theoretical basis
comes from statistics and its way of proceeding draws heavily on
scientific research, but data science as we know it is strongly influenced
by technology and software engineering methodologies and has largely
evolved in groups driven by computer science and information technology.

**These facts mean that in practice data science is often a "second
calling"**: many data scientists started out as programmers,
statisticians, business intelligence analysts or scientists. They had
already mastered a number of the skills needed for data science, and by
adding some more to their repertoire they turned into effective data
scientists.

Skills of a Data Scientist
========================================================

*So, what skills does a data scientist need to have?*

Data science as such is a relatively new field and, honestly, there is an
utter lack of agreement on what a curriculum on this subject should look
like. What is clear, however, is that **you need to learn a lot of
stuff.**

You'll often find diagrams like the one on the right. [It was proposed by
Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram),
data scientist, CEO and founder of Alluvium, as an attempt to define (at a
high level) what it takes to become a successful data scientist.

Skills of a Data Scientist
========================================================

Recently I've come across this version which adds an extra dimension, just
as important: *communication skills*.

We'll use this diagram as a starting point for a discussion, noting where
you probably are in it depending on your background and what you should do
next. Then it'll be up to you to decide whether data science is
actually your thing!
