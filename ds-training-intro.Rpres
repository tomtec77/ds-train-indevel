Welcome to the Data Science Training!
========================================================

Welcome indeed!


What is Data Science?
========================================================

The term "data science" probably appeared in the mid-1990s but became 
popularised by William Cleveland, computer scientist and statistician then
at Bell Labs, who in 2001 published the article
[*Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics*](https://utexas.instructure.com/files/35465950/download).

Cleveland defined data science as an **interdisciplinary field larger than
statistics itself**.

In PDSwR, Zumel & Mount define data science as **the management of a
process that can transform hypotheses and data into actionable predictions
and insights**.

Data Science as a "Second Calling"
========================================================

**Data science draws on many disciplines.** Much of its theoretical basis
comes from statistics and its way of proceeding draws heavily on
scientific research, but data science as we know it is strongly influenced
by technology and software engineering methodologies and has largely
evolved in groups driven by computer science and information technology.

**These facts mean that in practice data science is often a "second
calling"**: many data scientists started out as programmers,
statisticians, business intelligence analysts or scientists. They had
already mastered a number of the skills needed for data science, and by
adding some more to their repertoire they turned into effective data
scientists.

Skills of a Data Scientist
========================================================

*So, what skills does a data scientist need to have?*

Data science as such is a relatively new field and, honestly, there is an
utter lack of agreement on what a curriculum on this subject should look
like. What is clear, however, is that **you need to learn a lot of
stuff.**

Skills of a Data Scientist

You'll often find diagrams like the one on the right. [It was proposed by
Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram),
data scientist, CEO and founder of Alluvium, as an attempt to define (at a
high level) what it takes to become a successful data scientist.

Skills of a Data Scientist
========================================================

Recently I've come across this version which adds an extra dimension, just
as important: *communication skills*.

We'll use this diagram as a starting point for a discussion, noting where
you probably are in it depending on your background and what you should do
next. Then it'll be up to you to decide whether data science is
actually your thing!

***

<div class="midcenter"><div style="margin-left:-0px;margin-top:-250px;"><img style="margin:0px; background-color:transparent; border:0px; box-shadow:none;" src="images/aiQeT.png"></img></div></div>


Becoming a Data Scientist
========================================================

## Your goal:

This region is where you want to be; blending skills from statistics,
programming and domain knowledge.

If your communication skills are lacking but you're good in all the other
areas, you'll be able to do core data science but you're missing an
important part!

***

<div class="midcenter"><div style="margin-left:-0px;margin-top:-250px;"><img style="margin:0px; background-color:transparent; border:0px; box-shadow:none;" src="images/goal.png"></img></div></div>


Becoming a Data Scientist
========================================================

If you're **coming from academia** you are likely starting out from here.

Your main challenge is acquiring domain expertise - if you have a business
analyst in your team you should work closely together - and learning to
communicate with non-technical people about your work (you'll be doing
that a lot, so put some serious thought into it - it's not trivial).

***

<div class="midcenter"><div style="margin-left:-0px;margin-top:-250px;"><img style="margin:0px; background-color:transparent; border:0px; box-shadow:none;" src="images/from_academia.png"></img></div></div>


Becoming a Data Scientist
========================================================

If you're a **business analyst or actuary** you are somewhere around here.
You probably have good domain knowledge and statistical skills, what you
need is the programming and machine learning part.

Note that relative to the goal you are in the region opposite to the
scientist - that's why both profiles complement each other very well!

Becoming a Data Scientist
========================================================

If you're coming from **computer science or programming** and have
**little or no statistics or research experience**... you're in the
"danger zone"!

You know enough to grab data and program what looks like a legitimate
analysis, but you lack the theoretical basis to understand if what you
did is actually valid...

Slide With Plot
========================================================

<div class="midcenter"><div style="margin-left:-300px;margin-top:-250px;">

Slide With Plot
========================================================

*Do you really have to know all that?*

**Short answer: No, not really.**

**Longer answer: Well, it depends...**

- Where are you going to work?
- Who will be working with you?
- For whom are you going to work?


Slide With Plot
========================================================

This is a **very simplified** view of the data science process:

<div class="midcenter"><div style="margin-left:-400px;margin-top:-200px;"><img style="margin:0px; background-color:transparent; width=640px; border:0px; box-shadow:none;" src="images/dsprocess_simple.png"></img></div></div>

<br><br><br><br><br>
(*Actually, it is hardly ever a linear process - we'll get back to this...*)

As mentioned before, data science draws on many disciplines and
technologies. This is not only due to the diversity of the problems it
attempts to solve, but also because of the different tools needed at the
various stages of a project.


Slide With Plot
========================================================

*Will* **you** *have to do all of this?*

<div class="midcenter"><div style="margin-left:-400px;margin-top:-200px;"><img style="margin:0px; background-color:transparent; width=640px; border:0px; box-shadow:none;" src="images/dsprocess_simple.png"></img></div></div>

<br><br><br><br><br>
To be a good data scientist **you should certainly get involved in all the
stages of a project**, but whether you'll actually do them yourself is
another matter.

People were expecting data scientists to **actually do it all**,
which gave rise to the mythical "Data Science Unicorn".


Data Science can be a Team Sport
========================================================

### There is no 'I' in 'Data Science Team'!

Actually, there is one... "I focus on stating the problem, defining the
data we need, the analysis and extracting insights. The rest of the team
helps me make it work!"

This is a major advantage of being a data scientist here at Globant. We
work in teams, and there are plenty of skilled professionals who will
likely be in charge of business analysis, data extraction, and creating 
visualisations.


Must-Have Starting Skills
========================================================

- **Math, Statistics and Probability**
  - <small>These provide the bulk of the theoretical basis of data
  science. You don't need to know all the arcana of statistics, but you
  should be confident with concepts like descriptive measures, probability
  distributions, hypothesis testing.</small>
- **Programming in R or Python**
  - <small>Together they are the *lingua franca* of data science. Knowing
  one of the two will suffice, but you should aim at being proficient in
  one and have a sound knowledge of the other. This includes plotting!</small>
- **SQL**
  - <small>You'll spend a lot of time querying databases, so you need a
  good grasp of SQL. No need for database administration knowledge, but
  you should know the `SELECT` command inside out!</small>

  
Nice-To-Know Skills
========================================================

- **Big Data**
  - <small>A must-have for some - I think it's not, as I believe the core
  of  data science is actually machine learning. However, given the growth
  of data everywhere, the problems you'll be asked to solve will
  increasingly involve big data. (*And at Globant we're part of the Big
  Data Studio...*)</small>
- **Data Mining / Business Intelligence Tools**
  - <small>Pentaho, RapidMiner, Tableau... It's great if you know how to
  use them, but if you don't, no worries - plenty of skilled BI people
  here at Globant that can help with that if necessary.</small>
